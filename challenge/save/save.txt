We thought a lot about our life/motivation.
We read lots of blogs. <link> voyageautourdumonde
We discover why : <link> art2
We manage money issue <link> or not
and so on <link> gdocs </link>

</p>
The turning point
<p>
We found Zipworld <link> 
We thought a lot about destination.
Departure should be after graduation + 1 month so November
We wanted to live during the Summer so South Hemispher 
We wanted to avoid to pay a lot. The plane ticket allows us to take only one direction.
So we should South America, hence Oceania was next till April
Then Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam during the end of the Spring
North Hemispher in Summer: so China, Tibet, Nepal would be the following destination.
India to finish with the money we still have.
If you have a lot, we would be treated as prince there
If you have not money anymore, we would manage trip for few.
Dubai and we'll be back in November
We get 8 plane ticket for 2100€

</p>

The other formality
<p>
Time to buy stuff to pack
Time to look for visa
Time to get vaccinated and so one...
